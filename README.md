### Prattles App: Your place to hangout for chatting with your friends

This site is deployed [here](https://prattles.netlify.app/). The backend repository for the same is available [here](https://github.com/HarshitP147/prattles-backend).

The site is built using MERN stack. On the frontend side we have Typescript React, Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI and on the backend we have Express.js and MongoDB. Socket.io is the main library that is used for real-time interaction.
